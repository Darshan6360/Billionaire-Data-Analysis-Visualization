# Billionaire Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository presents a structured data science workflow for analyzing and visualizing billionaire-related datasets. It encompasses essential stages of data handling â€” from data ingestion and integration to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization. The project is implemented entirely in Jupyter Notebooks, making it reproducible, transparent, and easy to extend.

## Project Structure

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `billionaire.ipynb` | Performs initial data loading, inspection, and exploratory data analysis. Includes descriptive statistics and preliminary insights into billionaire demographics and wealth distribution. |
| `join-.ipynb` | Demonstrates dataset integration through joining and merging operations. It consolidates multiple data sources to enable richer and more comprehensive analyses. |
| `visualize.ipynb` | Focuses on data visualization, leveraging various libraries to generate meaningful plots and charts. It illustrates wealth distribution patterns, geographic trends, and industry-based insights. |

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Execute the notebooks in order:

   - Start with `billionaire.ipynb` for initial data exploration and analysis.  
   - Proceed to `join-.ipynb` for dataset merging and integration.  
   - Conclude with `visualize.ipynb` to generate insights through visual representations.
